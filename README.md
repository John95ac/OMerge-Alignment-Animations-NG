Special thanks to mrowrpurr "https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_HelloWorld", who created the tutorial for starting with SKSE. It's an incredible piece of work, really good for beginners. "She forgot to mention downloading GIT, but it's a minor detail. If you follow the tutorial without downloading GIT, you'll have a hard time like I did." This work is based solely on what I learned from her tutorials, and of course, my own contributions. I respect her conduct guidelines and license. Here is everything. Thanks, and if you want to learn how to do it, I recommend looking up her videosâ€”they are good.
